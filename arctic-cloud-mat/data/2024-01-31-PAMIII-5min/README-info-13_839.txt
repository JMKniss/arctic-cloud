Ice Camp Surface Mesonet NCAR PAM-III 5 minute (FINAL) [Andreas, E., et al.]
https://data.eol.ucar.edu/dataset/13.839

Summary
Six NCAR portable automated mesonet (PAM-III) stations were deployed in the
vicinity (within 5 km) of the SHEBA Ice Camp. Each station measures pressure,
temperature, RH, wind speed and direction, energy budget parameters (4) and
energy flux parameters (3). This dataset contains netCDF files for each day of
the deployment and contains data from all stations. There were only four
stations operating at any one time during the project. These data files
contain 5 minute averages of the data parameters. This data has been post
processed and quality checked.
