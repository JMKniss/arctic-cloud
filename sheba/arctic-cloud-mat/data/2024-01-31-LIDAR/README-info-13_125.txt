Summary
The Depolarization and Backscatter - Unattended Lidar (DABUL) is a pulsed
laser-radar operating at 523 nm wavelength. Range resolution is 30 m, and time
resolution is as short as 1 s. This dataset contains two final products: Lidar
returned-power netcdf data files, and Linear depolarization ratio netcdf data
files. All of the final products have been averaged for 10 seconds.
