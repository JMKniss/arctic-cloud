This directory contains ancillary broadband SW and LW data (upwelling & downwelling) from the flux tower in Eureka, Nunavut, Canada.  Environment Canada diffuse and direct SW data from the Safire Observatory is included for the purpose of quality control.  QCRad procedure was used to quality control the data.  Certain checks were turned off because of the concern on the distance between Safire and Flux tower (about 500 m).  I thank Bruce McArthur, David Halliwell, and Ormanda Niebergale at Environment Canada and Chuck Long at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory for making it possible to serve this dataset to public.
