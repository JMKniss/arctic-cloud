# Calibrating a Brunt-type model for DLR using arctic data
The equation for emissivity introduced by Brunt 1932:
        $$
        \varepsilon = c_1 + c_2\sqrt{P_w}
        $$
has shown to be, unsurprisingly, most accurate where the parameters are calibrated. 
Due to the unique atmospheric qualities at extreme latitudes (i.e. above the arctic circle), parameters calibrated from data in subtropical and mid latitudes perform poorly. 
The aim of this project is to calibrate an equation for estimating clear sky emissivity in arctic conditions, and further, to investigate an analytical connection between cloud optical thickness and cloud radiative forcing
